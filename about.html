        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I build interfaces that feel gentle yet purposeful. This page is a snapshot of what fuels my work, what I am
            learning, and the promises I’m making to my future self.</p>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a front-end developer and lifelong learner with a fascination for how thoughtful design can shift
                experiences from frustrating to delightful. My background blends community storytelling, design systems,
                and accessible engineering practices.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>This program is my structured playground to sharpen both craft and confidence. I am focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Elevating my component architecture skills to create scalable, design-forward interfaces.</li>
                <li>Deepening my understanding of performance budgets and how micro-optimizations affect real users.
                </li>
                <li>Contributing meaningfully to collaborative projects while leaving behind documentation that future
                    teammates can trust.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>Despite steady progress, I still feel uneasy when navigating advanced accessibility audits and complex
                animation timelines. I also wrestle with trusting my voice during code reviews, especially when the room
                is full of seasoned engineers. These are the areas I am actively practicing.</p>

        <article data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>Remember that growth rarely announces itself with fanfare. You promised to lead with curiosity, measure
                outcomes rather than hours, and care for your well-being as diligently as your backlog. Keep choosing
                the brave option, even when it means asking the uncomfortable question.</p>
            <blockquote>“You already have the permission you keep waiting to receive. Take it, and make something
                generous.”</blockquote>

        <aside data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Recently, the most inspiring feedback I received was that my work makes interfaces “feel kind.” It
                reminded me that empathy is a competitive advantage. I want every build to be a small invitation for
                someone to feel seen.</p>
